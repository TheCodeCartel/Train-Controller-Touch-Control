# Train-Controller-Touch-Control

A recreation of the first Arduino-based project I ever did. The original code was lost in a hard drive failure. It's made to operate a wireless controller for a G scale model train using a capacitive touchplate.

Very simple, very repetitive but it does the job. Well, it did.

This one compiles but doesn't work yet. It's been about three years since I wrote this and my memory is a little fuzzy.

Give me a few days and the sucker should be mildly useful.
