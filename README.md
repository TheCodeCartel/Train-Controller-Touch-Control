# Train-Controller-Touch-Control

Pre-Release Version 0.1

A recreation of the first Arduino-based project I ever did. The original code was lost in a hard drive failure. It's made to operate a wireless controller for a G scale model train using a capacitive touchplate.

Very simple, very repetitive but it does the job.

I've got it to the point where it's about what I have in use, the next version will include improvements to sensitivity and resistance to repeat triggering once I get a chance to load it onto an Arduino.

NOTE - YOU MUST HAVE THE CAPACITIVE SENSOR LIBRARY INSTALLED FOR THIS TO COMPILE AND WORK.
